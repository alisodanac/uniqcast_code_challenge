# ðŸ“º TV Guide App
This project is a TV Guide Application that allows users to browse TV channels, view program schedules, and set reminders for upcoming shows. The app efficiently handles large XML-based TV guide data and provides a smooth user experience with modern state management techniques.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
âœ… Test-Driven Development (TDD): The project was developed following TDD principles, ensuring a reliable and maintainable codebase with well-defined unit and integration tests.

âœ… Efficient XML Parsing: Since the TV guide data comes in large XML files, the app efficiently processes them in chunks, converting the data into Dart models without consuming excessive memory.

âœ… State Management with Riverpod: Riverpod was used as the state management solution to handle app-wide state efficiently and ensure optimal performance.

âœ… Reminders & Notifications: Users can set reminders for their favorite programs, and the app will send notifications to alert them before the show starts.

âœ… Clean Architecture: The app is structured using a Clean Architecture approach, separating concerns into Data, Domain, and Presentation layers, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

## ðŸ›  Features Implemented During Development
TV Channels & Program Listings: Displayed in a structured format with a horizontal list for channels and a vertical list for programs.
Efficient Data Fetching & Caching: Integrated both remote and local data sources to provide a seamless experience even when offline.
Custom XML Parser: Built a parser to extract relevant TV program details from the XML source while keeping memory usage minimal.
Reminder & Notification System: Implemented a feature allowing users to receive notifications before their favorite programs start.
Unit Testing: Ensured code quality and reliability by writing tests for key components, including data fetching, parsing, and state management logic.
This project showcases a well-structured Flutter app with robust data handling, efficient state management, and a user-friendly feature set. ðŸš€
